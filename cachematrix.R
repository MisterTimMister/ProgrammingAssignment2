## Functions to cache the inverse of a matrix.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## It creates a list of 4 functions that allow you to set the value of the matrix, get the value
## of the matrix, set the value of the inverse and get the value of the inverse.
## The function assumes that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setSolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getSolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setSolve = setSolve,
         getSolve = getSolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve 
## retrieves the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getSolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setSolve(m)
    m
}
